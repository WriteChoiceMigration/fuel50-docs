<Info>
Try the new W&B Inference service free. It gives you access to AI models through an API and the Weave Playground.

Follow these steps to track your first call. You can also <a className="inline-flex items-center" target="_blank" href="http://wandb.me/weave_colab"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

## 1. Install Weave and get your API key

**Install weave**

First, install the weave library:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install weave
```

```bash TypeScript
pnpm install weave
```
</CodeGroup>

**Get your API key**

Create a W&B account at https://wandb.ai. Then copy your API key from https://wandb.ai/authorize.

## 2. Log a trace to a new project

Follow these steps to track your first project:

- Import the `weave` library
- Call `weave.init('project-name')` to start tracking
  - The system asks for your API key if you haven't logged in yet
  - To log to a team, use `team-name/project-name`
  - Set the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable to skip the login prompt
- Add `@weave.op()` to the functions you want to track

_This example uses OpenAI. You need an OpenAI [API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key)._

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import weave
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Weave tracks the inputs, outputs and code of this function
@weave.op()
def extract_dinos(sentence):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": """Extract dinosaurs from the text. Return JSON with:
- dinosaurs: list of dinosaurs
- name: scientific name  
- common_name: nickname
- diet: herbivore or carnivore."""
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": sentence
            }
        ],
        response_format={ "type": "json_object" }
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


# Start the weave project
weave.init('jurassic-park')

sentence = """I saw a T. rex chase a Triceratops. 
The T. rex eats meat. The Triceratops eats plants.
A Brachiosaurus ate leaves from tall trees nearby."""

result = extract_dinos(sentence)
print(result)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import * as weave from 'weave';

const openai = new OpenAI();

async function extractDinos(input) {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: `Extract dinosaurs from this text. Return JSON with name, common_name, and diet: ${input}`,
      },
    ],
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}

const extractDinosOp = weave.op(extractDinos);

async function main() {
  await weave.init('examples');
  const result = await extractDinosOp(
    'I saw a T. rex chase a Triceratops. The T. rex eats meat. The Triceratops eats plants. A Brachiosaurus ate leaves from tall trees nearby.'
  );
  console.log(result);
}

main();
```
</CodeGroup>

When you call `extract_dinos`, Weave shows a link to view your trace.

## 3. Automatic AI library logging

Weave tracks calls to many AI services:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic  
- [Many more AI libraries](./guides/integrations/index)

Weave logs:
- AI model info
- Token usage
- Cost

To track other AI tools, wrap them with `@weave.op()`.

## 4. See traces in your project

Great job. Now Weave captures data every time you call your function. It also tracks code changes.
