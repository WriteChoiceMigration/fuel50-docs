## Implementation notes

- URL rewriting is currently happening to get rid of `/core/` and `/models/` in the current site. This was necessary because of Docsy's requirement that the left-hand navigation be derived from the file structure, rather than a component like `docs.json` which composes a navigation as desired. 
- In the migrated site, there is no need to have a `core` directory, as that section is being dissolved. 
- The migrated topics in this section (i.e. topics that were originally from the Hugo site) are to be moved under `/platform/` in the file structure, from their original locations. These will require redirects.
    - `/platform/hosting/`
    - `/platform/settings/`
    - `/platform/settings/secrets/`
