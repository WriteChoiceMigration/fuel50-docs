## What is W&B?

Weights & Biases (W&B) is the AI developer platform, with tools for training models, fine-tuning models, and leveraging foundation models.

W\&B consists of three major components: [Models](/guides/models), [Weave](https://wandb.github.io/weave/), and [Core](/guides/core):

**[W\&B Models](/guides/models)** is a set of lightweight, interoperable tools for machine learning practitioners training and fine-tuning models.

**[W\&B Weave](https://wandb.github.io/weave/)** is a lightweight toolkit for tracking and evaluating LLM applications.

**[W\&B Core](/guides/core)** is set of powerful building blocks for tracking and visualizing data and models, and communicating results.

## How does W\&B work?

Read the following sections in this order if you are a first-time user of W\&B and you are interested in training, tracking, and visualizing machine learning models and experiments:

1. Learn about [runs](/guides/runs), W\&B's basic unit of computation.
2. Create and track machine learning experiments with [Experiments](/guides/track).
3. Discover W\&B's flexible and lightweight building block for dataset and model versioning with [Artifacts](/guides/artifacts).
4. Automate hyperparameter search and explore the space of possible models with [Sweeps](/guides/sweeps).
5. Manage the model lifecycle from training to production with [Model Registry](/guides/model_registry).
6. Visualize predictions across model versions with our [Data Visualization](/guides/tables) guide.
7. Organize runs, embed and automate visualizations, describe your findings, and share updates with collaborators with [Reports](/guides/reports).
