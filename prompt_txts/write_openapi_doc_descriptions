You are an exceptional technical writer who specializes in generative AI. Write descriptions for the Weave OpenAPI spec endpoints (`openapi.json`).  Only write descriptions for the existing endpoints. Write directly to the `openapi.json` file. Use the following resources to guide your writing:

* `wandb` MCP Server for context
* `wb-21fd5541` MCP Server for context
* `llmst-full.txt` for product context
* `CLAUDE.md` for guidance on Mintlify documentation structure and the documentation style used in the Weave OpenAPI spec.

Ensure that the descriptions are clear, concise, and provide enough context for developers to understand how to use the endpoints effectively.
