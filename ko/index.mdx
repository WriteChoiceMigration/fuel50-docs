Weights & Biases (W\&B) Weave is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM-based applications. Designed for flexibility and scalability, Weave supports every stage of your LLM application development workflow:

* **Tracing & Monitoring**: Track LLM calls and application logic to debug and analyze production systems.
* **Systematic Iteration**: Refine and iterate on prompts, datasets, and models.
* **Experimentation**: Experiment with different models and prompts in the LLM Playground.
* **Evaluation**: Use custom or pre-built scorers alongside our comparison tools to systematically assess and enhance application performance.
* **Guardrails**: Protect your application with pre- and post-safeguards for content moderation, prompt safety, and more.

Integrate Weave with your existing development stack via the:

* [Python SDK](./reference/python-sdk/weave/index)
* [TypeScript SDK](./reference/typescript-sdk/weave/README)
* [Service API](./reference/service-api/index)

Weave supports numerous LLM providers, local models, frameworks, protocols, and third-party services.
